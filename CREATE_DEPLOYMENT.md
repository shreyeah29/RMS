# Create Manual Deployment in Vercel

## Steps to Deploy:

### Step 1: Click "Create Deployment"
- You should see the dropdown menu with 3 options
- Click on **"Create Deployment"** (the first option with the + icon)

### Step 2: Configure Deployment
You'll be taken to a deployment creation page where you'll:

1. **Select Git Commit:**
   - Choose "main" branch
   - Select the latest commit: "7fbd37f - Trigger Vercel deployment"

2. **Select Environment:**
   - Choose "Production" 

3. **Review Settings:**
   - Make sure Framework is set to "Next.js"
   - Build Command: `npm run build`
   - Install Command: `npm install`

### Step 3: Click "Deploy"
- After clicking "Deploy", Vercel will:
  - Clone your repository
  - Install dependencies
  - Build the Next.js application
  - Deploy it

### Step 4: Watch the Build
- You'll see a progress screen
- Build typically takes 2-5 minutes
- Watch for any errors

### Expected Output:
If successful, you'll see:
- âœ… Build succeeded
- Production URL (e.g., `rms-xxxxx.vercel.app`)
- Preview URL

## What to Share:
After deployment, share with me:
1. The production URL
2. Any build errors (if deployment fails)
3. Status (Ready / Error)

Let's get this deployed! ðŸš€
